# README

This application is a simple rails implementation for the addition to and manipulation of a database of Hellenistic moldmade bowls, as featured in Remy Jones' Master's thesis for Brandeis University. While writing this as a rails app is a little bit much for the queries currently hard coded, it was built with the intention that perhaps a greater database/search could be constructed in the future. The code and schema are open under an MIT licence but to obtain the data as a MySQL dump or CSV file, please contact Anna Krohn.

Data compilation and organization: Remy Jones

Code: Anna Krohn
